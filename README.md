# QR-bill

First, you’re importing the QRCode class from the pyqrcode library.
You print a welcome message: "Welcome to STEP_IN SHOP!!!!!".
You define a dictionary called data that contains various items and their corresponding prices.
Next, you prompt the user to input the items they want to buy (comma-separated).
The code calculates the total bill by summing up the prices of the selected items.
It then generates a QR code containing the bill details and saves it as “bill.png”.
now you can scan QR code
